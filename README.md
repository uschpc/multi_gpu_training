# Multi-GPU Training with PyTorch: Data and Model Parallelism

### About
The material in this repo demonstrates multi-GPU training using PyTorch. Part 1 covers how to optimize single-GPU training. The necessary code changes to enable multi-GPU training using the data-parallel and model-parallel approaches are then shown. This workshop aims to prepare researchers to use the new H100 GPU nodes as part of Princeton Language and Intelligence.

### Setup

Make sure you can run Python on Adroit:

```bash
$ ssh <YourNetID>@discovery.usc.edu  # VPN required if off-campus
$ git clone -b ITP-450 https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/multi_gpu_training.git
$ cd multi_gpu_training
```
